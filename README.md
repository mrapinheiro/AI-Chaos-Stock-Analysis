# Stock Market Prediction Using Physics and AI

## Overview
This project integrates concepts from physics and artificial intelligence to predict stock market prices. By drawing parallels from theories such as punctuated equilibrium and chaos theory, and utilizing statistical models like ARIMA, this repository offers a novel approach to understanding and forecasting market dynamics.

## Features
- **Chaos Theory Integration**: Generates chaotic data to simulate potential future price scenarios.
- **ARIMA Model**: Employs the ARIMA model for accurate time series forecasting.
- **Average True Range (ATR)**: Utilizes ATR to measure volatility and guide trading decisions.
- **Punctuated Equilibrium Concept**: Applies this concept from paleontology to identify significant bursts of price changes.

## Installation
To set up this project, you'll need Python along with several libraries. You can install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels yfinance
```

## Usage
The main script can be executed with Python. It fetches historical stock data, applies the ARIMA model and chaos theory for prediction, and provides trading signals.
```bash
python stock_prediction.py
```

## Files
- `stock_prediction.py`: The main script containing all the logic for fetching data, generating predictions, and providing trading instructions.

# Stock Market Prediction Using Physics and AI

## Overview
This project integrates concepts from physics and artificial intelligence to predict stock market prices. By drawing parallels from theories such as punctuated equilibrium and chaos theory, and utilizing statistical models like ARIMA, this repository offers a novel approach to understanding and forecasting market dynamics.

## Key Concepts

### Chaos Theory
Chaos theory suggests that small changes in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes in complex systems. This project uses chaos theory to generate possible price scenarios, reflecting the unpredictable nature of markets.

### Punctuated Equilibrium
Borrowed from evolutionary biology, this concept describes periods of stability punctuated by rapid change. Applied to markets, it helps identify significant price movements after periods of relative stability.

### ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
A statistical model for analyzing and forecasting time series data, particularly useful for stock price prediction.

## Features
- **Chaos Theory Integration**: Generates chaotic data to simulate potential future price scenarios
- **ARIMA Model**: Employs the ARIMA model for accurate time series forecasting
- **Average True Range (ATR)**: Utilizes ATR to measure volatility and guide trading decisions
- **Punctuated Equilibrium Concept**: Applies this concept from paleontology to identify significant bursts of price changes

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- yfinance

## Installation
To set up this project, you'll need Python along with several libraries. You can install the dependencies with the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install individual packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib statsmodels yfinance
```

## Usage
The main script can be executed with Python. It fetches historical stock data, applies the ARIMA model and chaos theory for prediction, and provides trading signals.

```bash
python stock_prediction.py
```

### Sample Output
```
Historical Stock Prices:
[Historical data output]

Chaotic Stock Prices:
[Chaotic prices output]

ARIMA Forecast for Next 5 Days:
[Forecast output]

2025-03-13 - Trading Instruction: Buy
```

## How It Works
1. **Data Collection**: Historical stock data is fetched using the yfinance library
2. **Chaos Generation**: The logistic map is used to generate chaotic data
3. **ATR Calculation**: Volatility is measured using the Average True Range
4. **ARIMA Forecasting**: Future stock prices are predicted using the ARIMA model
5. **Analysis**: Trading decisions are made based on a combination of ATR, price changes, and ARIMA forecasts

## Configuration
You can modify the following parameters in the script:
- Stock symbol (default: 'AAPL')
- Date range
- Chaos parameters (x0 and r)
- ARIMA order
- ATR threshold
